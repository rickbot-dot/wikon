Wikon 1.0 "Aggresive Animal" Install Guide
==========================================
This file explains how to install Wikon for your wiki. This process
is fairly simple and straightforward.

You should be logged in as root while following this tutorial.

Requirements
------------
You will need:
* An operating system other than Windows or similar systems.
  Alternatively, you can install Wikon on a Windows server with the
  Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
* Git
* PHP
* Apache, lighttpd, or nginx
* MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Support for more databases will be added
  with additional major updates. This guide is for Wikon 1.0.
  You will also need php-mysqli (php-mysql on some Linux distros),
  php-pgsql, or php-sqlite3 respectively.

Soft Requirements
-----------------
* To use the CaptchaEditing extension, install and enable the GD library.
* [for MySQL users only] For security reasons, you should disable
  .mysql_history by linking it to /dev/null. The file will contain your
  database password which could be used to perform admin-only actions
  with immoral hacking. You can do this with this command:

       rm ~/.mysql_history
       ln -s /dev/null ~/.mysql_history

Getting Wikon
-------------
Choose a path that your server software is set up to serve files at.

To install Wikon, run this command in the directory where you would
like to install it:

    git clone https://github.com/TylerMS887/wikon w --branch rel-full/aggressive --depth 1

This will download the entire Wikon 1.0 package. If you want to only
download the wiki and not bundled extensions, change "full" to "core".

Database Setup
--------------
Before your wiki can work, you will need to set up the database.
See below for instructions for each compatible SQL software.

MySQL Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~
MySQL is the recommended choice for Wikon wikis.

Run the MySQL.php script in the pre-setup-scripts folder that came with your
Wikon installation. Note that you should run MySQL.php via the terminal, as
it is not available via PHP server handlers such as apache2-php for safety reasons.

If you don't have access to the shell (most hosting providers disallow shell
access for safety reasons), you may be able to use a MySQL management
tool provided by your hosting service, such as phpMyAdmin or Adminer.
In that case, here's what to do:
1. Create a database, with any name.
2. Create a user, with any name or password. However, we recommend a strong
   password to prevent security breaches.
3. Grant the new user rights to the database.
4. When you are configuring Wikon, you can now enter the details for your
   database and password.

SQLite Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SQLite works pretty well with Wikon, because it is a simple server
that does not have permissions.

If you don't have access to the shell (most hosting providers disallow shell
access for safety reasons), you may be able to use an SQLite management
tool provided by your hosting service, such as phpLiteAdmin.

Run the following command in the directory where you want to store the
database:

    sqlite3 wikon.sqlite3

Then type .exit to leave the SQLite prompt, which we won't use.

This will create an empty SQLite database.
This path will be configured as the Wikon database in setup.

PostgreSQL Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PostgreSQL is not officially tested but should work.

If you don't have access to the shell (most hosting providers disallow shell
access for safety reasons), you may be able to use a PostgreSQL management
tool provided by your hosting service, such as phpPgAdmin.

Open the PostgreSQL console and run the following commands:

    CREATE USER wikiuser WITH NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOSUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';
    CREATE DATABASE wiki WITH OWNER wikiuser;

Replace "wiki" with the name of the database you would like to use, "wikiuser"
with the PostgreSQL username you would like to use, and most importantly,
"password" with a password to use for your user.

Do not leave the password as "password" as this is insecure and can be
thought to be leaked in this file.

Wikon Configuration
===================
Go to your wiki. If it shows this:

    LocalSettings.php not found. Please set up the wiki first. Refer to the installation guide for more info.

then your wiki structure has been stup. You can now click on "set up the wiki"
to set up your wiki.
